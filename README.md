# Spotify-Clone
This project is a Spotify Clone built using React.js. It includes features like signup and login pages, a responsive navbar, a sidebar for navigation, and a basic music player interface. The app uses React Router for navigation and is styled to look similar to the real Spotify app with dark theme colors and Spotify green highlights.
